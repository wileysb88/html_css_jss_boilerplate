# html_css_jss_boilerplate
Starting place for any front end project

## Technologies Used

* HTML, CSS and JS; Github

* HTML is on the skeleton html page. This is the skeleton of the website and the content that we generally see on our web browser. CSS is the styling of the page itself which we didn't affect just yet. JS is the muscle of the page and performs methods to the elements on the HTML or CSS. Github helps us save our repositories as we work on them to be able to push them to the internet.

* I really feel like i have a strong grasp on these topics for the most part which is just super exciting! I'm comfortable with pretty much everything we talked about today which is a victory!

* The lesson this morning at first gave me a bit of a headache because I wasn't using the variable of our function correctly. BUT when I grasped what I was doing wrong, it validated that I was thinking about things correctly! (Long way of saying I had a brain fart this morning and feel good that I actually knew what I was talking about)
